YouTube Comments Extension
==========================
This project is a browser extension designed for YouTube. It detects videos with disabled comments which activates our extension. The user will be redirected to a website where they can freely express their comments on whichever video they choose. Users can also communicate with others by liking and replying on other comments, just like you can on YouTube!

## Project Link
